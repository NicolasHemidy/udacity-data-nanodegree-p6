## How does teachers behaviour influence students attitude towards school across the world?

### Summary

Students attitude towards school is certainly a factor of success. Students from the PISA 2012 programme who considered school as a waste of time tended to have lower math scores.

But an even more interesting observation is the relationship between students attitude and their perception of their teacher. Students considering their teacher unfair tend to consider more school as a waste of time and tend to have lower math score.

### Design

After receiving first feedback from George, I applied the following modifications:

- Tell the story: add a title to make clearer the story I want to tell.
- Simplify the graph: I removed the OECD series. The distinction between OECD and NON-OECD students was interesting but not relevant to my story.
- Choose the right animation and chart: I changed my chart from a bubble chart to a bar chart. The evolution of math scores is way more easy to understand with the bar chart.
- Make the second chart more prominent: I increase the opacity of the second chart to make it more visible.

After receiving second feedback from George and first feedback from Joon, I applied the following modifications:

- Change the animation: I came back to the bubble chart to convey the evolution of the count of students who considers school as a waste of time.
- Support the story: I added a description on top of the left chart to explain the relationship between both charts.

After receiving the third feedback from audacity reviewer, I applied the following modification:

- added a description of my story above graphs and changed the naming of the question categories.
- changed the colour coding, the orientation and the scale of the y axis of the right-most graph and added an average math score on the main graph to support the story line more efficiently.

### Feedback

Feedback from George (Udacity forum mentor):

- hard to understand the underlying story behind the chart.
- not clear what I want to tell.
- bar chart could better convey the evolution of math scores.
- second chart is not visible enough.

Feedback from Joon (colleague):

- bar chart conveys the evolution of math scores but does not convey an important part of the story: the evolution of the number of students considering school as a waste of time. Explore a bubble chart again. Because you removed OECD series, the bubble chart might add more substance to the story without adding complexity to the story line. 

2nd Feedback from George (Udacity forum mentor):

- adding a description above the second chart to explain the relationship between both could help better understand the visualisation.

3rd Feedback from Udacity reviewer:

- adding a description of the story above the chart could easy its understanding.
- make clear that "Waste of time" and "Teacher treats students fair" are question which have been asked to students during the study.
- using a different colour coding of the graph on the right could help understand which category is filtered.
- using percentage and changing the orientation of the graph on the right could help understand the distribution of students.
- adding an average math score on the main graph could help understand the evolution of math score.

##### Dataset
The original data set is the PISA 2012 programme. It assessed the competencies of 15-year-olds in reading, mathematics and science (with a focus on mathematics) in 65 countries and economies. Around 510 000 students between the ages of 15 years 3 months and 16 years 2 months participated in PISA 2012 as a whole representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally.
